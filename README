This repository contains two sets of IOR results and Jupyter notebooks that
demonstrate the limitations of POSIX semantics on I/O scalability.

- `posix_consistency_effects` - Demonstrates how performance degrades for very
  small transaction sizes when strict POSIX consistency semantics must be
  maintained.  Compares Lustre shared-file writes (client cache + locking),
  DataWarp shared-file writes (no client cache, no locking), and Lustre
  file-per-process (as a proxy for client cache without locking) at various
  transaction sizes.
- `posix_open_scaling` - Demonstrates how the performance of opening a single
  shared file degrades as the number of concurrent I/O contexts increases.

More information and context into these data and plots will be posted online
as time permits.
